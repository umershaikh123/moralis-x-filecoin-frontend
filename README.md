# what is our project about?
 Our project aims to solve the issue of trust, transparency in the isssuance of funds for charity, fundraising, donations etc.
 users can create a cause which they need money to be raised for by filling the details of the cause which are stored on ipfs using `web3.storage`, and so as to discourage unnecessary causes each cause created by a user has to be voted 
 on, the voting is open and can be done by anyone but each wallet can only vote for a cause once, once a cause has been approved the `chainlink keepers`
 update the state of the cause and it is listed, once listed donations can be made to the cause, users can chat with the organizers using `Xmtp messaging
feature` anyone who donates to the cause gets a soul-bound nft made using `NFT.storage`.The cause is closed when the creator decides or when the specified goal has been reached.

# plans moving forward
  * We plan to implement a standard open dao which with each cause as proposals and ways to incentivize users to verify them
  * we plan to add support for donation of real world asssets or other digital assets
