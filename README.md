# what is our project about?
 Our project aims to solve the issue of trust, transparency in the isssuance of funds for charity, fundraising, donations etc.
 users can create a cause which they need money to be raised for, and so as to discourage unnecessary causes each cause created by a user has to be voted 
 on, the voting is open and can be done by anyone but each wallet can only vote for a cause once, once a cause has been approved the `chainlink keepers`
 update the state of the cause and it is listed, once listed donations can be made to the cause, users can chat with the organizers using `Xmtp messaging
 feature`
